    <p class="terms-updated reveal">Last updated: February 2026</p>

    <h2 class="reveal">Booking & Confirmation</h2>
    <ul class="reveal">
      <li>All bookings are confirmed only upon receipt of the advance payment. A date is not blocked until the advance is received.</li>
      <li>Please book well in advance, especially for bridal bookings, as dates fill up quickly and are available on a first-come, first-served basis.</li>
      <li>A booking confirmation will be sent via WhatsApp once the advance is received.</li>
      <li>Please share your event details (date, time, venue, number of people, outfit reference photos) at the time of booking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="reveal">Pricing & Extras</h2>
    <ul class="reveal">
      <li>Prices listed on the Services page are current as of the date shown. Pricing is subject to revision, but your quoted price will be honoured once a booking is confirmed.</li>
      <li>Add-on services such as additional saree draping, hair extensions, and extra person makeup are charged separately and will be communicated upfront.</li>
      <li>Any additional services requested on the day of the event that were not part of the original booking will be charged extra.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="reveal">Payment Terms</h2>
    <ul class="reveal">
      <li>A non-refundable advance of 50% of the total package cost is required to secure your booking.</li>
      <li>The remaining balance is due on or before the day of the event.</li>
      <li>Payments can be made via UPI, bank transfer, or cash.</li>
      <li>For multi-day bookings (e.g., wedding + reception), a combined quote will be provided with a single advance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="reveal">Cancellation & Rescheduling</h2>
    <ul class="reveal">
      <li>If you cancel your booking, the advance amount is non-refundable regardless of when the cancellation is made.</li>
      <li>Rescheduling is subject to availability and must be communicated at least 15 days prior to the original date. No additional charges apply if the new date is available.</li>
      <li>Cancellations from my end will only happen in the case of a life-threatening or medical emergency. In such a situation, a full refund of the advance will be provided, or an equally qualified replacement artist will be arranged with your approval.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="reveal">Trial & Pre-Bridal Consultation</h2>
    <ul class="reveal">
      <li>A makeup trial is highly recommended and should be scheduled at least 2 weeks before the wedding date.</li>
      <li>Trials are charged separately (see Services page for pricing).</li>
      <li>During the trial, we will discuss your preferred look, skin concerns, and any specific requirements for the day.</li>
      <li>Trial looks are kept confidential and will not be shared on social media without your consent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="reveal">Group & Family Bookings</h2>
    <ul class="reveal">
      <li>If you are booking makeup for family members or bridesmaids in addition to yourself, please confirm the total number of people at the time of booking.</li>
      <li>Each additional person requires approximately 60 to 90 minutes. A schedule will be shared in advance so everyone is ready on time.</li>
      <li>For large groups, an assistant artist may accompany me to ensure timely completion. This will be discussed beforehand.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="reveal">Travel & Accommodation</h2>
    <ul class="reveal">
      <li>Services within Chennai city limits are included in the package price.</li>
      <li>For venues outside Chennai, travel charges will apply based on distance and will be quoted at the time of booking.</li>
      <li>For outstation bookings (outside Chennai), the client is expected to cover travel and accommodation expenses for the artist and assistant (if applicable).</li>
      <li>Travel arrangements and costs will be discussed and agreed upon before confirmation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="reveal">On the Day of the Event</h2>
    <ul class="reveal">
      <li>Please ensure a clean, well-lit space with a chair and mirror is available for makeup application.</li>
      <li>The client should have clean, moisturised skin and clean hair (washed the previous day is ideal). Avoid trying new skincare products in the week before the event.</li>
      <li>I arrive at the agreed-upon time. If the client or venue is not ready, the waiting time will be deducted from the makeup session. I cannot extend beyond the scheduled window if there are subsequent bookings.</li>
      <li>Touch-ups during the event are included for bridal bookings as per the package terms. Please confirm the touch-up schedule in advance.</li>
      <li>Any request to extend services beyond the agreed scope on the day will be accommodated where possible but may incur additional charges.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="reveal">Photos & Social Media</h2>
    <ul class="reveal">
      <li>I may photograph the final look for portfolio and social media purposes.</li>
      <li>If you prefer that your photos are not shared publicly, please let me know at the time of booking and it will be respected without question.</li>
      <li>Client privacy is always respected. No full names, venue details, or personal information are shared without explicit consent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="reveal">Skin Sensitivity & Allergies</h2>
    <ul class="reveal">
      <li>Please inform me of any skin allergies, sensitivities, medical conditions, or specific product preferences at the time of booking or during the trial.</li>
      <li>I use high-quality, professional-grade products from reputed brands.</li>
      <li>A patch test can be arranged during the trial if you have sensitive skin. Please request this in advance.</li>
      <li>While I take every precaution, I cannot be held liable for allergic reactions to standard cosmetic products that were not flagged beforehand.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="reveal">Liability</h2>
    <ul class="reveal">
      <li>Makeup appearance may vary in photographs depending on camera settings, lighting conditions, and the photographer's editing style. This is beyond my control.</li>
      <li>Makeup longevity depends on factors such as skin type, weather, and post-application care. Following the aftercare recommendations provided will help your look last longer.</li>
      <li>I am not responsible for any changes made to the look by a third party after my services are complete.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="reveal">Agreement</h2>
    <p class="reveal">
      By confirming a booking and making the advance payment, you agree to the terms and conditions outlined on this page. These terms are in place to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience for both of us.
